# Drug-interaction-prediction

# Data preprocessing:
# MASSC: 
This file generates MACCS encoding for drugs
input: file with SMILES
output: SMILES and MACCS encoding for each drug

# Encoding Map (Deeppurpose): 
This file generates Deeppurpose encodings for proteins/drugs
For more information on deep purpose encodings you can check out here:

You will need to clone the DeepPurpose directory first before running this code.
input: file with SMILES/protein sequence
output: file containing drug/protein encoding
